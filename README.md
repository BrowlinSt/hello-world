# hello-world

I'm Browlin, Browlin Stroebel

I recently found a passion for coding 
And i write poetry in spare time which is not much 
I am very driven, passionate, determined, and focused 
In life I just don't want to dissapoint myself thinking about what I could have done different
There's alot to say about myself but I'm a introvert I don't speak much
